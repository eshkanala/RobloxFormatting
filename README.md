# RobloxFormatting

This project formats regular obj/glb files into usable roblox models. The script was created for the express use of converting AI generated models into roblox-usable models. Though the script does not create completely usable and clean models, it does create a basepoint for anyone who wants to go this route in roblox model creation.

# Usage

The glbtoobj.py file converts glb models to obj models, albeit with some problems regarding triangle faces.
The bpyauto.py auto file runs in blender and helps convert the model into a usable roblox model (detailed instructions at the top of the file).
